          Hi there! I{"'"}m Full-stuck Developer from Vietnam, working in web
          development. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple.
        </p>
        <p>
          My job is to build website so that it is functional, ease to use and
          reasonable. I enjoy to learn new stuffs that can be applied into work,
          so aim to make your product reach the threshold of perfection.

          Maybe I just looks like a cat chasing my damn {'"'}perfection{'"'}{" "}
          tail. I{"'"}m a Vimmer also a Starcraft player. Feel free to contact
          me. Have a nice day! 🍺
